# King Edward VI School Student Robotics 2024
Welcome to the heart of the King Edward VI Student Robotics 2024 team!\nThis is where code will be stored and managed, and you can contribute to it relatively easily.
\nIf you want to work on the code yourself, you'll first need to make a GitHub account. Then, go to the repository and fork it. Make your changes, push them to your fork, and make a pull request to Max. He should get back to you soon enough and boom, there's your code.
Make sure Max knows who you are; feel free to give him your GitHub username in school so he knows who's who.
